      Legend, magician, sorcerer, time traveler, or simply an extraordinary scientist who was just way ahead of his time. Nikola Tesla, born in 1856 was one of the most mysterious persons to walk on the earth. Legend has it that he was born during an electrical storm at the stroke of midnight. His magical inventions (over 100 years ago) that amazed his fellow scientists, included wireless transmission, remote control systems, an earlier version of florescent lights, the electric motor, AC power, radar, and numerous others. As a sorcerer, he created man-made lightning that terrorized the communities near his workshops. He could speak atleast 9 languages. Some speculate he was a time traveler, because how else could a man change Thomas Edison’s electrical power ideas from deadly and hazardous to the safe systems we all use today.

      <li><b>1882 - </b>Conceives of the AC induction motor, begins working for Continental Edison in Paris.</li>
      <li><b>1884 - </b>Leaves for America and gets a job in Edison’s company.</li>
      <li><b>1885 - </b>Leaves Edison and launches Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing, but the financial backers are unable to comprehend the technological advances and refuse to fund Tesla's AC Motor, and they fire Tesla.</li>
      <li><b>1887 - </b>Builds the first AC Induction Motor, makes a deal with George Westinghouse for production.</li>
      <li><b>1891 - </b>Demonstrates WIRELESS power transmission.</li>
      <li><b>1892 - </b>Discovers <b>X-RAY RADIATION</b> three years before they are rediscovered by Willhelm Roentgen.</li>
      <li><b>1893 - </b>Demonstrates a <b>Wireless Transmitter/Receiver system (RADIO)</b>,two years before Marconi's.</li>
      <li><b>1894 - </b>Generates 1,000,000 volts using a conical air-core Tesla Coil. He later achieves 16 foot discharges (lightning) in his New York City lab. That’s ONE MILLION VOLTS.</li>
      <li><b>1895 - </b>The fire which broke out in Tesla’s laboratory in New York destroyed all his apparatus, instruments, documentation, plans etc.</li>
      <li><b>1898 - </b>Demonstrates a wireless controlled boat. But, is unable to interest the military. He also develops an electric igniter for Gasoline Engines, the ignition coil, basically the same automobile ignition system used today.</li>
      <li><b>1899 - </b>Begins his Colorado Springs research with WIRELESS TRANSMISSION of messages and electrical power. Stories of Tesla’s experiments with man-made balls of lightning being projected from his lab, and citizens being electrocuted from unknown sources still remain today.</li>
      <li><b>1900 - </b>Begins building the Wardenclyffe Transmitter, a 200 KW system. Later that year he was issued patents for methods of transmitting wireless energy.</li>
      <li><b>1903 - </b>Patents #723,188 and #725,605, contain the basic principles of the logical AND circuit element basic to all computers.</li>
      <li><b>1904 - </b>Marconi is awarded the patent for radio, to which Marconi later recieved a Nobel Prize and Tesla begins his fight as the original inventor.</li>
      <li><b>1906 - </b>creates the 200 hp, 16,000 RPM Bladeless Turbine. </li>
      <li><b>1915 - </b>Signs over the Wardenclyffe deed to George Boldt, to pay a $20,000 debt, and to help fund his continuing lawsuit against Marconi.</li>
      <li><b>1916 - </b>Declares bankruptcy, owes back taxes, is penniless and living on credit at the Waldorf-Astoria.</li>
      <li><b>1917 - </b>Irony prevails as Tesla receives the Edison Medal, the most prestigious honor the AIEE can bestow upon an engineer.</li>
      <li><b>1928 - </b>Receives his last US patent at age 72, "Apparatus for Aerial Transportation" - similar to a helicopter or VTOL aircraft.</li>
      <li><b>1931 - </b>Turns 75 and is honored by being on the cover of Time Magazine, and received congratulations from more than 70 pioneers in science and engineering including Albert Einstein.</li>
      <li><b>1936 - </b>Badly injured in a car accident in New York. He never completely recovered from the obtained injuries to the end of his life.</li>
      <li><b>1943 - </b> Died (7 January) aged 87.</li>
      <li><b>1944 - </b>Tesla is finally awarded the Patent for Radio. A year afer his death.</li>

    <h3>Trivia</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The TESLA, a new unit of magnetic flux density in the metric system, is named in Nikola Tesla's honor. The new unit is equivalent to 10,000 Gauss.</li>
      <li>Tesla had 221 World Patents and was involved with, or helped influence countless others.</li>
      <li>The FBI ordered the Office of Alien Property to seize Tesla's papers and possessions although Tesla was a U.S. citizen since 1891. The papers and scientific work were eventually released and inherited by Tesla's nephew, Sava Kosanovich, and are now housed in the Nikola Tesla Museum in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.</li>
      <li>Westinghouse and Tesla provide AC power to light the 1893 Chicago's World's Fair. (In anger, Edison forbids the use of his light bulbs)</li>
      <li>Tesla arrived in New York at age 28 and began working for Thomas Edison to improve Edison's DC dynamos. Edison promises to pay Tesla $50,000 if he can improve the DC dynamo’s performance. Tesla succeeded beyond Edison’s expectations, but Edison reneges on his promise to pay Tesla $50,000 for improvements to his dynamos, saying he was just joking - Tesla resigned in disgust.</li> 
      <li>Tesla conceived of the AC induction motor, when he saw rotating fields in a vision, and then he meticulously detailed the construction of both single and polyphase motors in his notebook.</li>
      <li>The United States Postal Service honored Tesla with a commemorative stamp in 1983.</li>
      <li>Tesla was inducted into the Inventor’s Hall of Fame in 1975.</li>
      <li>The Nikola Tesla Award is one of the most distinguished honors presented by the Institute of Electrical Engineers. The award has been given annually since 1976.</li> 
      <li>The Nikola Tesla Statue is located on Goat Island to honor the man whose inventions were incorporated into the Niagara Falls Power Station  in 1895. Tesla is known as the inventor of polyphase alternating current.</li> 
      <li>The Nikola Tesla Corner Sign, located at the intersection of 40th Street and 6th Avenue in Manhattan, is a constant reminder to all New Yorkers of the greatness of this genius.</li>
      <li>He had a strict schedule for his everyday life. He worked for almost 15 hours a day with not more than two hours of sleep. He walked for eight to ten miles each day and did not have much of a social life.</li>
      <li>He had a photographic memory with the talent to speak in eight languages. He never married and did not have any known relationships despite the fact that many women were madly in love with him.</li>
